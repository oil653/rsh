## RSH - A simple POSIX shell written in Rust
> It will NOT run on windows, and im not planning to add support!

To run it clone the repo and build it with `cargo build --release`, and the bin will be ./target/release/rsh

## SOURCES:
I used [CodeCrafters's build your own shell](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview) as a guideline, for how it should function
